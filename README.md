This repo is a simple client-server example with Boost.Interprocess. It was created on Windows, but the concepts should be the same for any desktop platform.

## Prerequisites

This project requires Boost. You can download the latest Boost release [here](https://www.boost.org/users/download/).

Make sure you've run `bootstrap.bat`, then `b2` in your Boost install root. See [here](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/more/getting_started/windows.html) for more info.

## Running the example

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `build.ps1 -BoostRoot (path/to/boost)`
3. Run build/client.exe
